# Mat's Docker Image collection

Various Docker files that I use.

NOTE: You'll need TCL installed on your system. I use my own copy of `tangle`
based on literate programming. If you want to use a docker file, you'll have
to generate it.

## Docker Files

 * ubi9+epel
   * Redhat's Universal Base Image (UBI) for RHEL9, with epel installed and read for use.
